    "\n",
    "## More Simple Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To create simulation of the Monty Hall problem, we can simplify the approach by using a list to represent the doors. In this list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `0` represents a goat (losing door).\n",
    "- `1` represents the prize (winning door).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for the Simplified Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup the Doors:**  \n",
    "   Create a list `[0, 0, 1]` representing two goats and one prize. Randomly shuffle this list to simulate the random placement of the prize behind the doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Randomly Choose an Initial Door:**  \n",
    "   Randomly select an index (`0`, `1`, or `2`) to represent the contestant's initial choice of a door.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reveal a Goat Door:**  \n",
    "   Identify the remaining two doors that were not initially chosen:\n",
    "   - If both remaining doors are goats (`0`), randomly select one to reveal.\n",
    "   - If there is only one goat door (`0`), reveal that door.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Switch to the Remaining Door:**  \n",
    "   After revealing a goat door, switch the contestant's choice to the other remaining unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check for a Win:**  \n",
    "   Determine if the switched choice results in winning the prize (`1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of the Simplified Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability:**  \n",
    "  This approach is more straightforward because it eliminates the need to manage door numbers or handle edge cases involving removing and re-adding doors to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clarity:**  \n",
    "  The logic is clearer and more aligned with the problem's real-world setup, where the contestant switches between only two remaining choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:**  \n",
    "  Fewer lines of code and simplified control flow make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preferences Between Original and Simplified Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "While the original code correctly simulates the Monty Hall problem using explicit management of door choices and conditions, the suggested simplified approach improves readability and explainability. It avoids unnecessary complexity by focusing directly on the core logic of the problem—random choice, goat reveal, and switch decision. This makes the process more transparent and easier to understand, especially for those new to programming or the Monty Hall problem.\n"
