"""CSC148 Prep 4: Abstract Data Types

=== CSC148 Fall 2024 ===
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module Description ===
This module contains four functions for you to implement, where each
operates on either a stack or a queue.

We've provided deliberately confusing implementations of these ADTs in
adts.py. This is because we don't want you to care at all about the
implementations of these classes, but instead ONLY use the public methods
defined in by the Stack or Queue ADTs. These are the following:
    Stack
        - is_empty()
        - push()
        - pop()
    Queue
        - is_empty()
        - enqueue()
        - dequeue()

In particular, this means that you shouldn't try to access any attributes
of either class, since the ADT descriptions only define what *operations*
(methods) can be used for the ADTs.

GENERAL HINT: save values in local variables! Even if you pop an item off of
a stack, it's not "gone forever" if you assign it to a variable.

# buggy implementation, but pass on a working version of add_in_order().

# You are not required to fix the bug, although you may do so if you'd like.
