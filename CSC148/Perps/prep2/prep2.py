# Part 1
# In this part of the prep, you will be implementing a Spinner class.
# A 'Spinner' refers to the type of spinner used in games.
#
# For example, consider the following spinner with 4 slots:
#           0
#           ^
#      3    |     1
#
#           2
# Initially, the spinner arrow's position (represented by the line |) is at 0.
#
# If we spin and force it to move forward 1 spot, then it'll look
# like this:
#           0
#
#      3     ----> 1
#
#           2
# And the spinner arrow's position is now at 1.
# If we force it to move another 2 spaces, then it'll look like this:
#           0
#
#      3 <----     1
#
#           2
# Where the spinner arrow's position is at 3.

class Spinner:
    """A spinner for a board game.

    A spinner has a certain number of slots, numbered starting at 0 and
    increasing by 1 each slot. For example, if the spinner has 6 slots,
    they are numbered 0 through 5, inclusive.

    A spinner also has an arrow that points to one of these slots.

    Attributes:
    - slots:
        The number of slots in this spinner.
    - position:
        The slot number that the spinner's arrow is currently pointing to.

    Sample Usage:

    Creating a spinner:
    >>> s = Spinner(8)
    >>> s.position
    0

    Spinning the spinner:
    >>> s.spin(4)
    >>> s.position
    4
    >>> s.spin(2)
    >>> s.position
    6
    >>> s.spin(2)
    >>> s.position
    0

        The spinner wraps around once it reaches its maximum slot, starting
        back at 0. See the class docstring for an example of this.

        Precondition: force >= 0

        Hint: use the "%" operator to "wrap around" the spinner's position.
              The "%" operator gets the 'remainder'.
              For example, 8 % 6 == 2

        This modifies the spinner's arrow to point to a random slot on the
        spinner. Each slot has an equal chance of being pointed to.

        You MUST use randint (imported from random) for this method, to
        choose a random slot. Check out the official Python documentation:
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint
