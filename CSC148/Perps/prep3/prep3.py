# Part 1
# In this part of the prep, you will implement the total_pay method of the
# Employee class.
#
# You may add new PRIVATE instance attributes to the class to help store a
# record of the payments. Private instance attributes are attributes whose
# names start with _ and should not be accessed by code outside of the class.
#
# Document any new attributes in your class docstring, include type annotations
# for them in the class body, and make sure you initialize them properly
# in the Employee.__init__ method. You can, and should, also update the
# Employee.pay method implementation to update your new attribute(s).
#
# You may assume as a precondition that the pay method is not called on the
# same employee twice in the same month.
#
# NOTE: You only need to change the Employee class, and you should NOT change
# its two subclasses (they will simply inherit the Employee.total_pay method).
